## Transpose Data into Marker-Dominant Files (Illumina)

The *.sampRAF* files created previously (in Parse Samples Files) contain one sample per file. This step creates a copy of the data but with one marker per file. This allows the same marker to be examined for each sample without iterating through every sampRAF.

#### 1: Parse Sample Files step [parse-samples] must have been run already or must be selected
This step uses the sampRAF files (same text as in previous step)
