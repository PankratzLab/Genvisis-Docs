## Annotate Sample Data File

This step adds columns to **data/SampleData.txt**. You will see an error message if the duplicates identified by PLINK don’t agree with the **linker.txt** duplicates. It’s more likely that a sample list is wrong than PLINK’s algorithms, so, if an error occurs, you should update **linker.txt** and **pedigree.txt** to agree with PLINK.
