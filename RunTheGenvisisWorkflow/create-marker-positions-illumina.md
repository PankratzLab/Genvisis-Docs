## Create Marker Positions
This step uses an Illumina manifest file to determine where probes lie in the genome.

#### 1: An Illumina Manifest file
Choose the [.csv version of the manifest](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BMu1zp8er9NY-QFRh-7ZOeX1HnGj_yAYYh3BarASwPY/edit?pli=1#bookmark=id.e14mve4bgxmr) used to create the original project in GenomeStudio. This file should already be saved in the project directory.

#### 2: (optional) Perform LiftOver to lift manifest positions to project build
Check this option if your manifest is in a different genome build than the Genvisis project (e.g., if the manifest is hg37 but Genvisis was set to hg38 during project creation).
