## Process Affymetrix CEL Files 

#### 1: Create Marker Positions step [affy-markers] must have been run already or must be selected

#### 2: Directory with Affymetrix Power Tools executables (should contain apt-probset-genotype, etc.)
These files begin with **apt-**, such as **apt-probeset-genotype**.

#### 3: Directory with Affymetrix Power Tools library files (should contain GenomeWideSNP_6.cdf, etc.)
These files begin with **GenomeWideSNP_6**, such as **GenomeWideSNP_6.cdf**.

#### 4: A target sketch file (such as hapmap.quant-norm.normalization-target.txt)
This comes with Affymetrix Power Tools.

#### 5: (optional) Use the full Affymetrix cdf, which contains more mitochondrial probesets
This option may be of interest if you are examining mitochondrial DNA copy number.

#### 6: (optional) Sample name override file containing the following two columns: CurrentID, DesiredID
Samples will be named after their .CEL file.  For example, NA12878.CEL will be named NA12878 in Genvisis files such as SampleData.txt.  To give samples different names than their .CEL files, supply a text file with two columns and no header.  In the first column place the current sample name and in the second column place the new name.

#### 7: Number of threads
Genvisis can process .CEL files in parallel. More threads will result in the job finishing faster, but requires more
memory usage.
