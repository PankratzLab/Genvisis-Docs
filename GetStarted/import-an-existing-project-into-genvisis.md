# Import an Existing Project

If you already have a Genvisis project, you can import that project instead of creating a new project.

1. In Genvisis, go to **File** → **Import Project**.
2. The **Genvisis Project Import** pop-up window will appear. There will be a list of requirements each with a red x next to them
3. Click **…** next to **Project Directory**.
4. Choose the directory of an existing project and click **Select**
5. **New Project Name** will now contain the name of the project. Each red x will turn green if nothing is missing.
6. Click **OK** to load the project.
