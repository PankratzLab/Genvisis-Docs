## Introduction
Welcome to the Genvisis software documentation. Genvisis is a Java based software suite that automates best practices 
for processing and visualizing genomic data.

### What can Genvisis do?

* Call Copy Number Variants (CNV)
* Call Mitochondrial DNA Copy Number
* Export genotype data to VCF format so that it can be imputed to a reference panel
* Detect Mosaic Chromosomal Alterations
* Correct for batch effects
* Visualize CNV and mosaic events
* Visualize marker quality
* Visualize the genetic distance between individuals
* Determine how many X and Y chromosomes each subject has
* Compare the relative effect sizes of different genetic signals
* Visualize genetic signals across all loci in the genome
* Identify deviation from the expected distribution of p-values
