# Introduction
Welcome! Genvisis is a Java-based software suite that automates best practices for processing and visualizing genomic data.

## What can Genvisis do?
* Call copy number variants (CNVs)
* Call mitochondrial DNA copy number
* Export genotype data to VCF format so that it can be imputed to a reference panel
* Detect mosaic chromosomal alterations (MCAs)
* Correct for batch effects
* Visualize CNV and mosaic events
* Visualize marker quality
* Visualize the genetic distance between individuals
* Determine the number of X and Y chromosomes in a subject
* Compare the relative effect sizes of different genetic signals
* Visualize genetic signals across all loci in the genome
* Identify deviation from the expected distribution of p-values
