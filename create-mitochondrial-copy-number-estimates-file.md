## Create Mitochondrial Copy-Number Estimates File

#### 1: Transpose Data into Marker-Dominant Files step [transpose] must have been run already or must be selected

#### 2: Project must have mitochrondrial markers

#### 3.1: A file containing mitochondrial markers with clean clusters must exist (see http://genvisis.org/MitoPipeline/scatter.html for more details)

#### 3.2: Use all mitochondrial markers

#### 4: LRR SD threshold to filter samples

#### 5: Call rate threshold to filter markers

#### 6: (optional) Computer PCs with samples passing QC only

#### 7: (optional) Impute mean values for NaN

#### 8: (optional) Should recompute Log-R ratio for PC markers?

#### 9: (optional) Should recompute Log-R ratio for median markers?

#### 10: (optional) Homozygous only?

#### 11: Regression distance for the GC adjustment

#### 12: Number of threads

#### 13: (optional) A file listing a subset of samples (DNA ID) to use for determining optimal PC selection, typically a list of unrelated and single race samples. If a list is not provided, only samples passing sample qc thresholds will be used

#### 14: (optional) An external beta file to optimize PC selection

    * Skip if you donâ€™t have mitochondrial data
