# Manhattan Plot

ManhattanPlot implements a standard way of visualizing a genome-wide association study and makes it easy to see the strongest genetic signals and the support they have from other variants in linkage disequilibrium with them.

Manhattan Plot shows the p-values for variants included in a GWAS. It is helpful as a visual check to see if there are any hits and where any significant regions are, as well as the general distribution of p-values for the data.  The plot displays a threshold of 10-5 and a significant threshold of 10-8.  

Takes as input a file with a header and at least three columns - chromosome, position, and p-value:

    Chr  	Pos  	P-value
    1   	12541586 0.4427
    1   	13576290 0.4384
    2   	11273187 0.4229

The chromosome column must contain integers (eg. "chr1" will cause an error).  Additional columns in the file will be listed in the **Load File** pop up window with checkboxes next to them (default is off). There is also a **P-Value Filter** (default <= 0.05) and **Select Chrs**: column (default is to load all chromosomes except for Chr0 or unknown chromosomes).

This three column input file can be used in [QQ Plot](../#/documentation/VisualizeWorkflowResults--qq-plot) as well.

A Manhattan Plot can also be generated from the command line with:

    java -jar genvisis.jar org.genvisis.cnv.plots.PlotUtilities results=[input file to parse] manhattan=true hitwindows=true

The input file at the command line requires 3 columns - marker name/snp, p-values, and frequency:

    MarkerName    P-value    Freq
    chr11:12541586:A:G    0.4427    0.6873
    chr8:102803998:G:A    0.8713    0.0011
    chr13:55101557:T:C    0.9473    0.9955

The marker name/snp column either must contain chromosome and position information, or a map file has to be included separately (eg. map=plink.bim). Frequency can also be included in a separate file (eg. freq=plink.frq). The column order in the input files doesnâ€™t matter and there can be additional columns.  The results files from SNPTest (combined.results) or METAL (*\_InvVar1.out) can be used as input with no changes necessary.  The output is  **[input\_file]\_topmed\_rebuild\_Manhattan\_data\_manPlot.png**.
