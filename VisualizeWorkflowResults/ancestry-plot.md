# Ancestry Plot

AncestryPlot displays the result of a standard principal components analysis (PCA). Exploring higher-order PCs can help us distinguish between more closely related populations and identify possible haplotype effects or batch effects that we want to address prior to including these samples in a genetic analysis.

Click on raceImputations_step# on the left side of the plot to turn on PC1 and PC2. The HapMap samples are included and color coded (red = European, blue = Yoruban, purple = Chinese, green = Japanese). As the _step# increases, the axes become more level. The ImputedRace button under the x-axis will color the points based on what the predicted ancestry of the individuals is.
