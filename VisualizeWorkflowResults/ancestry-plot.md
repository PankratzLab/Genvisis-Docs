# Ancestry Plot

AncestryPlot displays the result of a standard principal components analysis (PCA). Exploring higher-order PCs can help us distinguish between more closely related populations and identify possible haplotype effects or batch effects that we want to address prior to including these samples in a genetic analysis.

To turn on PC1 and PC2, click **raceImputations_step#** on the left side of the plot. The HapMap samples are included and color-coded (red = European, blue = Yoruban, purple = Chinese, green = Japanese). As the **step#** increases, the axes become more level. Clicking the **ImputedRace** button under the x-axis will color the points based on the predicted ancestries of the individuals.
