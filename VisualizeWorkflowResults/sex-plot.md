# SexPlot

SexPlot displays the median log R ratio for the X chromosome on the x-axis and for the Y chromosome on the y-axis. Genvisis will categorize each individual as XX, XY, XO, XXX, XXY, XXYY, or XYY (including mosaic versions of each of these), and clicking on an individual will link to [Trailer Plot](../#/documentation/VisualizeWorkflowResults--trailer-plot) so you can visually confirm these assignments.

Most of a sex chromosome will have its Log R Ratio below the center line, but in pseudoautosomal regions, such as the first 2.7 Mb of chrX will have a higher intensity than elsewhere in the chromosome. The B allele frequency plot shows the number of AA, AB, and BB markers. In pseudoautosomal regions, there will be a mixture of all three, as in an autosomal chromosome. Elsewhere in a sex chromosome, there are no AB markers.

Carats on the Log R Ratio plot (^ or v) represent intensities way above or way below the line. Females will have mostly down carats, or null genotypes, for chrY. Markers that do appear on chrY for female samples are global markers that cross hybridize and are therefore problematic.
