# ForestPlot

ForestPlot implements a standard way of visualizing the relative effect sizes of genetic variants across multiple strata. This could be for the same phenotype across multiple studies or for multiple phenotypes from the same study, with the effect estimate of the meta-analysis shown as a diamond. Additionally, ForestPlot can be used to demonstrate the relative contribution of multiple variants to a polygenic risk score.
