# Forest Plot

ForestPlot implements a standard way of visualizing the relative effect sizes of genetic variants across multiple strata. This could be for the same phenotype across multiple studies or across multiple phenotypes for the same study, with the effect estimate of the meta-analysis shown as a diamond. It could also be used to demonstrate the relative contribution of multiple variants to a polygenic risk score.
