# Custom Plot

CustomPlot allows you to plot any two variables from any file, including variables in different files that can be linked by sample ID, and to color-code them by any variable found in SampleData. Moreover, if there are sample ID and genomic location columns in the file (or if the name of the file is a genomic location), then clicking on a dot will open [Trailer Plot](../#/documentation/VisualizeWorkflowResults--trailer-plot) for that region of that individual.
