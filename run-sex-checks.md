### Run Sex Checks

We want to avoid regions on chrX that have homologies on chrY (beyond the pseudoautosomal regions that are already known to be homologous).

To do so,
1. provide a file listing one hit wonders (markers that map to one location on a genome and nowhere else)
2. take information from the BLAST annotation in Step 3
3. check the box to “Use only X and Y chromosome R values to identify sex discriminating markers”
