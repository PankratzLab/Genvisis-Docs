# Open an Existing Project

When you first open GenomeStudio, there will be a list of existing projects under the **Start Page** tab. If you see your project, simply double-click on the its name. If your project is not listed, go to *File > Open Project*, go to the directory that contains the **.bsc** file of the project, and then click **Open**.
