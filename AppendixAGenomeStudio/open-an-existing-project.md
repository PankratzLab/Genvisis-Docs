# Open an Existing Project

When you first open GenomeStudio, there will be a list of existing projects under the **Start Page** tab. Double click on the desired project. If your project is not in this list, go to *File > Open Project*. Navigate to the directory that contains the .bsc file of the project and then choose **Open**.
