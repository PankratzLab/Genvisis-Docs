# Finding Illumina Manifest Files

GenomeStudio projects use manifest files in the form of a ***.bpm** file. However, Genvisis needs a ***.csv** version of a manifest with probe sequences for its first step of creating marker positions. If you have only the ***.bpm** version of a manifest, you can convert it to ***.csv** in a Linux environment with Genotype Library and Utilities:
glu-1.0b3-prerelease4-Linux\_x86-64/glu convert.dump\_bpm manifest.bpm -o manifest.csv

Check that the new ***.csv** manifest contains probe sequences. These are found in the columns named AlleleA\_ProbeSeq and AlleleB\_ProbeSeq. The A probe must have ACGT sequences in every row to be useful. The B probe is typically null for most rows, which is fine.

If the ***.csv** file does not contain probe sequences, youâ€™ll need to obtain an array from the Illumina website. They maintain a list of product files here. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click **Load All**, and then search for the relevant manifest.

For example, suppose the manifest GSA-24v2-0\_A2.bpm is included with a GenomeStudio project that we receive from a wet lab. On the Illumina downloads page, there is a section for the Infinium Global Screening Array v2.0 Product Files. It has ***.bpm** and ***.csv** manifests for GRCh37 and GRCh38. Our **SNP\_Map.csv** file (that GenomeStudio produced along with its final reports) uses positions from GRCh38, so we choose that ***.csv** manifest and verify that the name of the ***.csv** file is identical to the ***.bpm** we have, i.e., **GSA-24v2-0\_A2.csv**.

Unfortunately, Illumina uses ftp to transmit the files, and web browsers have stopped supporting ftp. When you click on the link for the file, a new tab will open with a blank webpage. As a workaround, copy the ftp link from the address bar and use it with wget in a Linux environment:
wget ftp://webdata:webdata@ussd-ftp.illumina.com/Downloads/ProductFiles/HumanOmniExpressExome/v1-1/HumanOmniExpressExome-8-v1-1-C.csv
