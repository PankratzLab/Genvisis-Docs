Running the Genvisis Workflow

Genvisis data processing is run from a workflow of steps that automate best practices. The Genvisis Workflow can be opened from the toolbar (check the Workflow button) or from Data > Genvisis Project Workflow.

The Workflow window lists all the steps that can be run. To run a step, check the box next to the numbered step. Text will turn green for portions of the step that can be run and red for portions that have missing requirements. Higher number steps may not be able to run without earlier steps being run first. Auto-populated file names will be green if they exist and red if they don't exist.

The first four steps of the Workflow vary based on the platform of your original data (Illumina or Affymetrix). The rest of the steps are the same for all datasets.
