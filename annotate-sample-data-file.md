### Annotate Sample Data File

This step adds additional columns to **data/SampleData.txt**

This step will give an error if the duplicates identified by PLINK don’t agree with the **linker.txt** duplicates. It’s more likely that a sample list is wrong than PLINK’s algorithms, so **linker.txt** and **pedigree.txt** should be updated to agree with PLINK if an error occurs.
